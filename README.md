# RL-implementations

The code from this repository is mostly comming from : [https://github.com/whikwon/TD3](https://github.com/whikwon/TD3)*

After an extensive cleanup we are mostly using the following files with some modifications :
* main.py (learn_policy.py)
* TD3.py  (TD3.py)
* DDPG.py (DDPG.py)

## Usage Examples

```sh
python learn_policy.py --policy_name DDPG --environment 'MountainCarContinuous-v0'
python run_policy.py --policy_name DDPG --environment 'MountainCarContinuous-v0'
```
