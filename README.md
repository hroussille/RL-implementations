# RL-implementations

The code from this repository is mostly comming from : [https://github.com/whikwon/TD3](https://github.com/whikwon/TD3)

After an extensive strip we are mostly using the following files with some modifications :
* main.py (runner.py)
* TD3.py  (TD3.py)
* DDPG.py (DDPG.py)

Those modified implementations are mostly used to test our [custom gym environment](https://github.com/hroussille/RL-evaluation-environment)

And to provide additional functionalities related with :

* Benchmarking
* Constraint state space
* Custom Replay Buffer with visualization
* and more..
